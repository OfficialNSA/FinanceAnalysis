# Finance Analysis VR Bank

## Description

This script should help you making your financial overview simpler. It takes csv Exports of your income and expenses and condeses them in minimalistic diagrams and overview for you to easier cross-check your financial decisions of the past.

## Limitations

This script is optimized for the csv structure of the Volksbanken Raiffeisenbanken Ludwigsburg and may not work out of the box with your csv file.

## Usage

### Preparation

Run the program once. It will abort but create the folder structure for you.

Place all your csv exports from the bank in the `Bank Exports` folder. Name them as you like, the program will scan all contents of this folder and sort it alphabetically and use the file name later in the Excel.
The timespan of your Exports is free to choose. I recommend monthly, named with YYYY.MM.csv.

### Action

You may now run the analyse.py file.

It will automatically categorise your expenses and income based on the `categories.json` contents. Because it is empty at the first time, it will prompt you for every payment.

Follow the instructions and create categories by typing the name or reuse them based on the shown index (type the number). Tell the script if it should automatically assign the category based on the receiver or the reason or if it should not use similar information for further categorising. You can also specify if some other keyword should be used in the future. (e.g. shorten "AMAZON EU S.A R.L., NIEDERLASSUNG DEUTSCHLAND" to "Amazon"). The Script is not case senstive.

When the program finishes, you will have an Excel file with the analysed data.
The first sheet contains an overview of all the data you have analysed. After that you will have a sheet for every file with the analysis for this timespan.

# Future

If you are interested in the expansion of this script hit me up then we can sort out how we can make it happen.

Things I have in mind right now but not enough time at hand:

- "Legacy" support for PDF format of 'Kontoausz√ºge'
- Maybe the charts a little more pretty
- Possibility to ignore payments in the chart/analysis (e.g. to family members, saving accounts etc.)
